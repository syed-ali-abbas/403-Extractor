## 403 - Extractor
Every Bug Hunter may face a problem of HOW to Extract URL's responding with 403 (Forbidden) status code and test them for 403 bypasser. Facing the same, I came up with a solution to automate this process to get rid of manually testing each URL's response. Follow the below steps:

Clone https://github.com/syed-ali-abbas/403---Extractor.git
cd 403-URLS-Extractor/
Python3 $inputfilePath $outputfilePath
Wait for the script to execute...
